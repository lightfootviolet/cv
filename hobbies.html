    <h4>My Hobbies~</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blender 3D modeling~ I love to design and craft assets within the digital space within a software program called <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. </li>
        <li>Roller Skating~ When I was fourteen, I applied to work at a roller rink, AKA <a href="https://www.medinaskateland.com/">Medina Skateland</a>. I worked there for several years, 
            those of which I call the best working years of my life. I have been roller skating ever since! </li>
        <li>Dog Training~ I have two jack russell terriers named Penny and Peridot. I train them in my free time, take them to the dog park, walk them and show them lots of love. 
            Sometimes I even skate while they pull me around the neighborhood!</li>
        <li>Video Gaming~ I have been playing video games ever since my mom brought me a copy of Pokemon Red Version and a turqoise gameboy! Games have always been a top hobby of mine.</li>
